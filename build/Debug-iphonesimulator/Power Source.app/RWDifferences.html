	<h1>Real-World Limitations</h1>
	
	<p>Although this application offers unparalleled interactivity, it does have limitations that separate the function of this system from its real-world counterpart.   Here's what this application <i>doesn't</i> do.</p>
	<ul>

	<li>AC Inverter not depicted</li>

	<li>Ground Service Bus not depicted</li>

	<li>Shed Bus control is not available. However, the shed buses will always be powered when the GPU Selected or if there are 3 or more generators online.</li> 

	<li>Individual battery control not available.</li>

	<li>Battery temperature information not available.</li>

	<li>Battery discharge rate has been intentionally set to discharge a faster rate for the purposes of simulation.  Battery without a power source on the ground will discharge at 0.10 volts every second.  A Battery powering Essential Buses alone will discharge 0.10 volts every 8 seconds.</li>

	<li>Backup battery control not available.</li>

	<li>Several Abnormals cannot be simulated, including:
		<ul>	
			<li>Generator overloads.</li>
			<li>Battery over-temperature(s).</li>
			<li>Limits on charging batteries.  The batteries can be drained to 0 and charged back to 24.0 volts in this application.</li>
			<li>Inadvertent essential power configuration on the ground.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
