<h1>Real-World Limitations</h1>
<p>Although this application offers excellent simulation paired with unparalleled interactivity, it does have limitations that separate the function of this system from its real-world counterpart.   Here's what this application <i>doesn't</i> do.</p>
<ul>
<li>AC Inverter not depicted</li>

<li>Ground Service Bus not depicted</li>

<li>Shed Bus control is not available. However, the shed buses will always be powered when the GPU Selected or if there are 3 or more generators online.</li> 

<li>Individual battery control not available.</li>

<li>Battery temperature information not available.</li>

<li>Backup battery control not available.</li>

<li>Several Abnormals cannot be simulated, including:
<ul>
	<li>Generator overloads.</li>
	<li>Battery over-temperature(s).</li>
	<li>Limits on charging batteries.  The batteries can be drained to 0 and charged back to 24.0 volts in this application.</li>
	<li>Inadvertent essential power configuration on the ground.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
